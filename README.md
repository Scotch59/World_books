Greetings to all who visited.
This project was completed for educational purposes and personal use.
Important, I use:
﻿asgiref==3.7.2
  Django==4.1.4
  django-cleanup==8.1.0
  pillow==10.2.0
  sqlparse==0.4.4
  tzdata==2024.1
  I use a database: SQLute3
This project is a simple library that contains books that I have read or am about to read, and there is also a brief summary and information about the author of the book for almost every book.
I will briefly describe the structure of the site’s data models and attach a table!
